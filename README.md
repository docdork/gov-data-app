Floods - Fetches and displays a list of current flood warnings. Click on filter and change the number which changes the API call based on the user inputed severity changed in a modal by the user - results in a new list.  Click on the details and it displays a different form of the info fetched.

Police - Fetches a list of forces.  This list can then be filtered to the desired Force.  When clicked, the ID of the force in the list is used to fetch the details of that force from a seperate API call.
